<body>

Implementation of a authorisation filter based on OIOSAML.

<h2>About</h2>

The Authz filter can perform access control checks based on the value of a user assertion attribute.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>OIOSAML.java must be installed and configured</li>
<li>The AuthzFilter must be added to web.xml</li>
<li>A configuration file with access control definitions must be created</li>
<li>A oiosaml-sp property must be pointed to the configuration file</li>
<li>The received assertions must contain one of the following attributes: dk:gov:virk:saml:attribute:ProductionUnitIdentifier or dk:gov:saml:attribute:CvrNumberIdentifier</li>
<li>The received assertions must contain the attribute "dk:gov:virk:saml:attribute:Authorisations" (the user authorisations)</li>
<li>The autorisations must follow the schema described below</li>
</ul>

<h3>Access rules</h3>

Access control rules are defined in a separate xml file which follows a simple structure:
<pre>
&lt;Protections xmlns="http://www.itst.dk/oiosaml/authz/2008/08/" default="deny"&gt;
	&lt;Resource name="urn:dk:cvr:cVRnumberIdentifier:13124930"&gt;
		&lt;Url path="/admin/.*"&gt;
			&lt;Privilege name="urn:dk:serviceprovider1:privilege:administerTaxes" /&gt;
		&lt;/Url&gt;
	&lt;/Resource&gt;
&lt;/Protections&gt;
</pre>
 
 <ul>
 <li>The top element is Protections, and the namespace is http://www.itst.dk/oiosaml/authz/2008/08/</li>
 <li>The top element can have a default attribute of either allow or deny. The default value is allow. This defines what happens if no rules match a request.</li>
 <li>Under Protections, a number of Resource tags can be defined. They have one required attribute, name, pointing to the required organisation.</li>
 <li>Each Resource can have a list of Url tags. These describe conditions on a request url (without query parameters). The path attribute is required, and is used as a regular expression. 
 Thus, /admin matches a request against /admin in the current servlet context. /admin/* matches all requests made under /admin.</li>
 <li>The Url tag also accepts the "method" attribute if the restriction is only valid for specific HTTP methods. If the attribute is not set, or the value is "*", all methods will match.</li>
 <li>Under each Url a number of Privileges can be added. These are the privileges required to access the path. If more than one privilege is defined, 
 only one of them has to match the user's privileges.</li>
 <li>Processing is top-down. This means that if more Urls match the same path, the first match will be used.</li>
 <li>Several Resource tags with the same name will be collapsed into one Resource.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Step one is to write the access control file. Create the file, and place it somewhere on the server. It's probably a good idea to place it in 
oiosaml-sp.home (unless configured otherwise, this will be $HOME/.oiosaml).</p>

<p>Edit oiosaml-sp.properties and add a property named oiosaml.authz.config which should point to the access control file, relatively to oiosaml-sp.properties.</p>


<p>Then enable the Authz filter. To do this, place oiosaml-authz.jar in WEB-INF/lib and add the following block to web.xml:</p>
<pre>
	... SPFilter here...
	
	&lt;filter&gt;
		&lt;filter-name&gt;authz&lt;/filter-name&gt;
		&lt;filter-class&gt;dk.itst.oiosaml.authz.AuthzFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;
	&lt;/filter&gt;
	
	... SPFilter mapping here ...
	
	&lt;filter-mapping&gt;
		&lt;filter-name&gt;authz&lt;/filter-name&gt;
		&lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
	&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;
</pre>

<p>Edit the url-pattern to match local needs. Make sure the AuthzFilter is defined after the SPFilter, and that the filter-mapping is defined after the 
SPFilter mappings. Any mapping for AuthzFilter must also be covered by SPFilter.</p>

<p>Start the container and check that access is being controlled.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

By default, a HTTP 403 error is issued when access is denied. If this is not appropriate, a new servlet can be defined, and errors will be redirected to this.
To do this, simply define a servlet (any will do, including jsp) and configure it in oiosaml-sp.properties:
<pre>
oiosaml.authz.servlet=/error.jsp
</pre>

<p>Set the property oiosaml.authz.servlet to point to the servlet path of the error servlet. No extra attributes are added to the request object.</p>
