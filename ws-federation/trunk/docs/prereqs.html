<h1>Requirements for the WS-Federation Extension</h1>

<p>Before the extension is installed into an application server, there are some configuration changes which are necessary:</p>

<h2>Prepare the JDK for unlimited crypto</h2>
<p>To support encryption, the JCE Unlimited Strengh crypto support must be installed. To do this, go to <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>, 
go to download of the appropriate JDK version and select "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy" (probably at the bottom).
This is a small zip file, containing two jar files. These two files must be copied to JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security, overwriting the existing files.</p>

<h2>Endorse new Xerces version</h2>
<p>OIOSAML.java requires Xerces 2.9.1 in order to work. Because the JDK already contains an XML parser, the old one must be overwritten. Choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(Recommended) Copy the META-INF dir from the distribution file to WEB-INF/classes in the application. This keeps the change local to your application,
	and does not change anything in any other applications which might be deployed on the same server. However, this method requires a recent version of the JDK.</li>
	<li>Endorse xerces in the application server. <a href="https://svn.softwareborsen.dk/oiosaml.java/sp/trunk/docs/endorsement.html">The OIOSAML documentation has information on how to do this</a>.
	<li>It might also be necessary to specify the correct implementation using system properties. For example, the GlassFish container sets a property which specifies another parser, which must then be overwritten.</li>
</ul>
