<h1>Installation of the demo application</h1>
<p>The WS-Federation extension package comes with a demo application which can perform the necessary protocol operations, display
the SAML assertion after signin and initiate signout. The demo can be used as a base for a new application, or just to try the extension out.</p>

<p>The demo is packaged as a war file ready for deployment. However, first <a href="prereqs.html">review the prerequisites</a> before continuing.</p>

<p>Deploy the application to an application server such as Tomcat or GlassFish. Check the logs and make sure there are no errors. If there are, they
are probably due to XML parser malconfiguration, in that case go back to <a href="prereqs.html">the prerequisites</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The extension needs a number of configuration files. In the demo application, these are stored in ~/.oiosaml-wsfed, where ~ is the user directory of 
the user running the application server. If this dir does not exist, it is created automatically.</p>

<p>When the configuration dir is empty, the server is unable to run in operational mode until the server has been configured. Configuration happens
using an online service.</p>

<p>Access http://&lt;server&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/saml/WSFedConfigure to configure the application. On this page, you must enter a couple of details about the
new installation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Keystore: JKS or PKCS12 keystore containing the private key and certificate for the instance.</li>
	<li>Create new keystore: This can be used for development if a new self-signed keystore should be created for the instance. The created keystore can
	be retrieved later on.</li>
	<li>Password: Password for the keystore. The same password is used for the keystore and the key itself.</li>
	<li>STS Entity Id: This must match the value of the Issuer element in the Assertion.</li>
	<li>STS WS-Federation endpoint URL: The location which handles WS-Federation Passive protocol requests.</li>
	<li>STS WS-Federation logout endpoint URL: The location which handles WS-Federation Passive logout requests.</li>
	<li>STS Certificate: A file containing the STS certificate in Base 64 encoded format, and with ----- BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE ----</li>
</ul> 

<p>Also, make sure that the hostname in the protocol urls is the actual name of the site - if users use another hostname to access it, cookies will be lost, and 
signon will not work.</p>

<p>Press Configure to configure the system. After the system has been configured, remember to also configure it in the STS.</p>

<p>At this point, the application should be ready for use. The configuration can be downloaded as a zip file, or it can be reviewed in ~/.oiosaml-wsfed.</p>

<p>To test the installation, access http://&lt;server&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/ and click Page requiring login. This should initiate the signon process and
redirect the browser to the STS. After successful authentication, a page with the contents of the assertion received is displayed. Click Logout to test
the logout feature.</p>
