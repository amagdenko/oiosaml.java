Release note, r9118p1

This release contains a fix for an encoding bug in the SOAP Single Sign Out (SSO) function
causing users with language-specific characters in their names to receive an error.
Previous release used the default character encoding of the platform whereas current
uses UTF-8. In addition a minor update has been applied to the documentation.
