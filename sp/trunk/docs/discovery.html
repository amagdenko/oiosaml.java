<h1>OIOSAML Discovery Profile</h1>
<p>This document explains how the Discovery profile is implemented in OIOSAML.</p>


<p>The discovery implementation contains two parts: A discovery service, which can read the _saml_idp cookie and transport it as a request parameter, 
and support in the SP.</p>

<p>The discovery service is a simple servlet, which reads the cookie and redirects the browser back to a url given as a request parameter. The value of 
the _saml_idp cookie is appended to the url.</p>


<p>Discovery is initiated in SPFilter, which checks if discovery is enabled (more than one IdP metadata file is available). If so, it checks
if _saml_idp is present in the  url, and if not, the browser is redirected to the discovery service.</p>

<p>When the browser returns, SPFilter checks if the requested IdP is available and retrieves its metadata. From here, AuthnRequests are issued as
usual.</p>


<p>Each time a request is sent from the SP, the request id is saved in LoggedInHandler together with the destination IdP entity id. When responses
arrive, the IdP metadata is found by using InResponseTo to find the original IdP entity id.</p>


<p>The discovery profile has the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a LogoutRequest is received, and the user has already timed out, and there is no Issuer included in the request, the process will stop, and an exception will be thrown.
  This happens because the proper redirect url cannot be determined.</li>
<li>If the value of _saml_idp is an unsupported IdP, an exception is thrown - however, if it's empty, the default IdP is used.</li>   
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Enabling Discovery profile</h3>
 <p>To enable discovery profile, the following steps must be completed:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Save all participating Identity Providers' metadata in metadata/IdP/ in separate files. The file names are not important, as long as they end in .xml</li>
 <li>Deploy the discovery service on a server in the common domain, and at a secure url</li>
 <li>Set oiosaml-sp.discovery in oiosaml-j.properties to point to the discovery service</li>
 <li>Optionally, set oiosaml-sp.discovery.default to point to a default IdP entity id, which will be used if no _saml_idp cookie has been set in the current session. If this is not set, the first IdP metadata will be used.</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>When these steps have been completed, discovery profile will be enabled automatically.</p>


<h2>The Discovery Service</h2>
<p>The discovery service is a simple web application, and is bundled in the distribution file. Simply deploy oiosaml.java-discovery.*.war to a 
servlet container. No further configuration is necessary.</p>

<h2>Prompting the user for an IdP</h2>
<p>In cases where a discovery service is not configured, or no _saml_idp cookie exists, the user will be prompted to choose an IdP. This behavoir can be
modified in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set oiosaml-sp.discovery.prompt to false - this will select the first IdP metadata and sign on using that. Which IdP is the first is not defined.</li>
<li>Set oiosaml-sp.discovery.default to an IdP entity id. This IdP will then be used if no values was discovered.</li>
<li>Set oiosaml-sp.discovery.prompt.servlet to point to a local servlet defined in web.xml. This servlet will then be called when the user is prompted instead
of the default one. By implementing this servlet, it is possible to modify the layout and functionality of the page. The servlet receives one attribute in the 
request: "entityIds", which is a Map&lt;String, String&gt; containing entityId -&gt; urls. The url must be used as is to select the corresponding IdP, probably
in an a tag.</li>
</ul>
