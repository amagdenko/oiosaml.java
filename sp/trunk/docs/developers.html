<h1>Developer information</h1>
<p>This section contains information for developers. It contains the following parts: one about customization, accessing runtime
information, and one about how the source code for OIOSAML.java itself is structured.</p>

<h2>Runtime information</h2>
<p>Pages protected by SPFilter can access information about the authenticated user and the associated SAML assertion in a number of ways. 
In all cases, the SAML information is contained in a dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.UserAssertion object. Generally, only types from dk.itst.oiosaml.sp should be used from
the application itself. Using types outside this package (including subpackages) is not supported or recommended. 
Instances of UserAssertion can be retrieved using these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>request.getSession.getAttribute("dk.itst.oiosaml.userassertion")</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.UserAssertionHolder.get()</li>
<li>request.getRemoteUser() - this will return the subject name identifier</li>
<li>request.getUserPrincial() - this will return a dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.OIOPrincipal</li>
</ul>

<p>If IsPassive is set (using a property in oiosaml-sp.properties), the UserAssertion will not be valid. This can be checked with assertion.isAuthenticated().
If this method returns false, the user has not been authenticated, and should be treated as an anonymous user. To force a login, redirect the user to saml/login.</p>

<h2>Developer Mode</h2>
<p>When developing a new application, it might be an issue to get a connection to a real IdP, and it might also disturb any automated integration tests.
To overcome this, the filter has a special developer mode where it will not issue any redirects. Instead, it will create a dummy-assertion with
configurable user and attributes.</p>

<p>To enable developer mode, simply set oiosaml-sp.develmode=true in oiosaml-sp.properties. It is not necessary to go through the configuration
process when using this mode, so simply create the file and set the property.</p>

<p>For the developer mode to work, it is necessary to configure one or more users. Do this by setting oiosaml-sp.develmode.users to a comma-separated list of usernames.
If only one is specified, this user will be selected automatically, otherwise a simple page will be shown where the user can be chosen.</p>

<p>Attributes can be defined for each user by setting oiosaml-sp.develmode.&lt;username&gt;.&lt;attributename&gt;=attributevalue.</p>
<p>Remember that if attribute names contain ;, it must be escaped using \.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> When developer mode is enabled, no checks for valid assertions are made whatsoever!</p>

<h2>Force Authentication</h2>
<p>
    Some times it is desirable to force a user to login again even if the user already had a valid authentication session.
    This can be accomplished by adding the query string parameter "forceAuthn=True" to the query string when requesting a page.
</p>

<h2>Attribute Query</h2>
<p>Attribute Query must be performed programatically. How to use Attribute Query is described in <a href="attributequery.html">in the Attribute Query guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>A number parts of OIOSAML.java can be directly: the the page used for sending POST requests when authenticating a
user, the error page, and other advanced parts. In the demo, the post page is called postlogin.jsp, and contains a simple POST form.</p>

<p>The default page does not submit the form automatically using Javascript, it just builds a basic form which the user must submit. A
new page can use the following request attributes to build the form (using ServletRequest.getAttribute()):</p>

<ul>
<li>SAMLRequest: Value of the SAMLRequest parameter</li>
<li>RelayState: Vaulue of the RelayState parameter</li>
<li>action: Action attribute for the form</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the values are correctly encoded, so they should be inserted into the form without further processing.</p>

<p>The customized page must be accessible as a servlet in the local web application. The path to the servlet must be configured in
oiosaml-sp.properties (see <a href="configuration.html">the configuration section</a> for more information about configuring OIOSAML.java) using 
the property POSTDispatchPath.</p>

<h3>Error Page</h3>
<p>The error page is used whenever SAML processing  fails. Like the login page, it is a servlet, which can be configured using a property. The page receives two objects in the request:</p>
<ul>
<li>error: String containing an error message</li>
<li>exception: The associated exception, if any</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the error page is rendered from an internal template.</p>

<h3>Assertion Validation</h3>
<p>When assertions are received, they are automatically validated according to the OIOSAML specification. The validation code can be controlled by implementing the 
dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.model.validation.AssertionValidator interface and injecting the class into the system using a <a href="configuration.html">configuration property</a>.</p>

<h3>Re-POSTing after SSO</h3>
<p>If the user does not have an active session (due to for example timeout) and makes a POST request to a protected page, the POST request
will normally be lost after the SSO process has completed. However, OIOSAML.java captures information about the last request made and
replays it after the user had been authenticated. For GET requests, this results in a 302 redirect. For POST requests, a HTML page is displayed
with a form containing the original form data.</p>

<p>By default, the form is a very simple page which displays all form fields and asks the user to either submit the request or cancel it. However,
it is possible to customize the page.  The mechanism is the same as when customizing the error page. Set the property called oiosaml-sp.repost
to point to a local servlet path. This servlet must then display a form for reposting the request. The servlet received two attributes in the request:
"request" and "home". The request attribute contains a dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.session.Request object with all the information about the
original request (all parameter names and values have been html encoded). The home attribute contains the address for the default home page, in 
case the user wants to cancel the request.</p>
 
<h3>State management</h3>
<p>See the <a href="clustering.html">clustering guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Authentication Hooks</h3>
<p>It is possible to receive a notification when a user has been authenticated by the SAML filter. To do this, implement the interface
dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.AuthenticationHandler. This interface has one method, userAuthenticated, which is called when an assertion has been
validated without errors.</p>

<p>Authentication handlers can be used to do further authentication or lookups, which should not be performed on every request.</p>

<p>The userAuthenticated method returns either true or false. If false is returned, processing is aborted, and the user will not be authenticated 
by the filter, which means that no objects are added to the session.</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>See the <a href="logging.html">separate section on logging</a>.</p>



<h2>Source code structure</h2>
<p>The source code consists of an Eclipse project with Java source code, unit tests, documentation, jar file dependencies, the demo files, and build files. <a href="http://gant.codehaus.org/">Gant</a>
is used for building the project, and the target 'build_everything' will perform a full build. Gant will need to be installed in order to build the project</p>

<p>Dependencies are managed through <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a>. This means that dependencies are described in ivy.xml and downloaded automatically when the project is
built.</p>

<p>No code generation is used, so the Eclipse project can be imported to Eclipse without any changes, and should be able to compile and run.</p>

<p>Unit tests are located in test/ and are baed on Junit4. The tests can be run with either ant using the target 'test' or from Eclipse. To run the tests
from Eclipse, simply right-click on the test folder and select Run As -> JUnit Test.</p>

<p>Packages in use:</p>
<ul>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp: Contains all public types. These are the types which can safely be used outside OIOSAML.java itself</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.bindings: SAML bindings are implemented here</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.configuration: The autoconfig implementation and the Velocity templates used for autoconfig</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.metadata: Types used for metadata handling</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.model: SAML 2.0 types. These wrap OpenSAML objects to add more functionality. These wrapper types are used instead of static util methods</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service: Classes which communicate with the IdP. SSO and SLO is implemented here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Configuration is done through Apache commons-configuration. The main config file is src/config.xml, which loads two config files: 
src/oiosaml-common.properties and ${oiosaml-j.home}/oiosaml-sp.properties. The common properties file contain properties which have default
values, and which do not normally need to be changed. These properties can be overwritten in oiosaml-sp.properties.</p>

<p>It is possible to access configuration through dk.itst.oiosaml.configuration.BRSConfiguration.getSystemConfiguration().</p>


<h3>Servlets</h3>
<p>Only one servlet is used in OIOSAML.java, dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.DispatcherServlet. This servlet dispatches to a number of SAMLHandlers which act as protocol endpoints.
DispatcherServlet has a static configuration of which urls are mapped to which handlers.</p>

<h3>Protection filter</h3>
<p>Resources can be protected with a filter: dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.SPFilter. This filter checks if requests have a valid session. If so, a UserAssertion is placed in UserAssertionHolder, which 
is a ThreadLocal. If the request does not contain an authenticated session, the filter delegates to a BindingHandler, which either issues a HTTP Redirect or displays a POST form, 
depending on the SAML binding in use. The BindingHandlers are responsible for issuing AuthnRequests.</p>

<p>Responses to AuthnRequests are received by SAMLAssertionConsumer, which validates the Response and registers the assertion in the user's session.</p>

<h3>Running without SPFilter</h3>
<p>In some scenarios, it might be preferable to run without the SPFilter, but instead handle user checking manually. In that case,
the logic from SPFilter must be duplicated. This is quite simple: SPFilter handles three tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It checks if the user is already authenticated. It does so by looking in the HTTP session to check if there is a valid assertion.</li>
<li>It handles IdP Discovery</li>
<li>It generated AuthnRequests using OIOAuthnRequest and delegates to a BindingHandler.</li>
</ul>
<p>If SPFilter is disabled, it is also necessary to start cleanup tasks manually. The tasks in question are the CRLChecker and LoggedInHandler#scheduleCleanupTasks().</p>
