<h1>Developer information</h1>
<p>This section contains information for developers. It contains the following parts: one about customization, accessing runtime
information, and one about how the source code for OIOSAML.java itself is structured.</p>

<h2>Runtime information</h2>
<p>Pages protected by SPFilter can access information about the authenticated user and the associated SAML assertion in a number of ways. 
In all cases, the SAML information is contained in a dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.UserAssertion object. Generally, only types from dk.itst.oiosaml.sp should be used from
the application itself. Using types outside this package (including subpackages) is not supported or recommended. 
Instances of UserAssertion can be retrieved using these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>request.getSession.getAttribute("dk.itst.oiosaml.userassertion")</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.UserAssertionHolder.get()</li>
<li>request.getRemoteUser() - this will return the subject name identifier</li>
<i>request.getUserPrincial() - this will return a dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.OIOPrincipal</i>
</ul>

<p>If IsPassive is set (using a property in oiosaml-sp.properties), the UserAssertion will not be valid. This can be checked with assertion.isAuthenticated().
If this method returns false, the user has not been authenticated, and should be treated as an anonymous user. To force a login, redirect the user to saml/login.</p>

<h2>Attribute Query</h2>
<p>Attribute Query must be performed programatically. How to use Attribute Query is described in <a href="attributequery.html">in the Attribute Query guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>Two parts of OIOSAML.java can be directly: the the page used for sending POST requests when authenticating a
user, and the error page. In the demo, the post page is called postlogin.jsp, and contains a simple POST form.</p>

<p>The default page does not submit the form automatically using Javascript, it just builds a basic form which the user must submit. A
new page can use the following request attributes to build the form (using ServletRequest.getAttribute()):</p>

<ul>
<li>SAMLRequest: Value of the SAMLRequest parameter</li>
<li>RelayState: Vaulue of the RelayState parameter</li>
<li>action: Action attribute for the form</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the values are correctly encoded, so they should be inserted into the form without further processing.</p>

<p>The customized page must be accessible as a servlet in the local web application. The path to the servlet must be configured in
oiosaml-sp.properties (see <a href="configuration.html">the configuration section</a> for more information about configuring OIOSAML.java) using 
the property POSTDispatchPath.</p>

<p>The error page is used whenever SAML processing  fails. Like the login page, it is a servlet, which can be configured using a property. The page receives two objects in the request:</p>
<ul>
<li>error: String containing an error message</li>
<li>exception: The associated exception, if any</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the error page is rendered from an internal template.</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>See the <a href="logging.html">separate section on logging</a>.</p>


<h2>Source code structure</h2>
<p>The source code consists of an Eclipse project with Java source code, unit tests, documentation, jar file dependencies, the demo files, and build files. <a href="http://gant.codehaus.org/">Gant</a>
is used for building the project, and the target 'build_everything' will perform a full build. Gant will need to be installed in order to build the project</p>

<p>Dependencies are managed through <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a>. This means that dependencies are described in ivy.xml and downloaded automatically when the project is
built.</p>

<p>No code generation is used, so the Eclipse project can be imported to Eclipse without any changes, and should be able to compile and run.</p>

<p>Unit tests are located in test/ and are baed on Junit4. The tests can be run with either ant using the target 'test' or from Eclipse. To run the tests
from Eclipse, simply right-click on the test folder and select Run As -> JUnit Test.</p>

<p>Packages in use:</p>
<ul>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp: Contains all public types. These are the types which can safely be used outside OIOSAML.java itself</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.bindings: SAML bindings are implemented here</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.configuration: The autoconfig implementation and the Velocity templates used for autoconfig</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.metadata: Types used for metadata handling</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.model: SAML 2.0 types. These wrap OpenSAML objects to add more functionality. These wrapper types are used instead of static util methods</li>
<li>dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service: Classes which communicate with the IdP. SSO and SLO is implemented here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Configuration is done through Apache commons-configuration. The main config file is src/config.xml, which loads two config files: 
src/oiosaml-common.properties and ${oiosaml-j.home}/oiosaml-sp.properties. The common properties file contain properties which have default
values, and which do not normally need to be changed. These properties can be overwritten in oiosaml-sp.properties.</p>

<p>It is possible to access configuration through dk.itst.oiosaml.configuration.BRSConfiguration.getSystemConfiguration().</p>


<h3>Servlets</h3>
<p>Only one servlet is used in OIOSAML.java, dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.DispatcherServlet. This servlet dispatches to a number of SAMLHandlers which act as protocol endpoints.
DispatcherServlet has a static configuration of which urls are mapped to which handlers.</p>

<h3>Protection filter</h3>
<p>Resources can be protected with a filter: dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.SPFilter. This filter checks if requests have a valid session. If so, a UserAssertion is placed in UserAssertionHolder, which 
is a ThreadLocal. If the request does not contain an authenticated session, the filter delegates to a BindingHandler, which either issues a HTTP Redirect or displays a POST form, 
depending on the SAML binding in use. The BindingHandlers are responsible for issuing AuthnRequests.</p>

<p>Responses to AuthnRequests are received by SAMLAssertionConsumer, which validates the Response and registers the assertion in the user's session.</p>

<h3>Running without SPFilter</h3>
<p>In some scenarios, it might be preferable to run without the SPFilter, but instead handle user checking manually. In that case,
the logic from SPFilter must be duplicated. This is quite simple: SPFilter handles three tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It checks if the user is already authenticated. It does so by looking in the HTTP session to check if there is a valid assertion.</li>
<li>It handles IdP Discovery</li>
<li>It generated AuthnRequests using OIOAuthnRequest and delegates to a BindingHandler.</li>
</ul>
<p>If SPFilter is disabled, it is also necessary to start cleanup tasks manually. The tasks in question are the CRLChecker and LoggedInHandler#scheduleCleanupTasks().</p>

<h3>Assertion Validation</h3>
<p>When assertions are received, they are automatically validated according to the OIOSAML specification. The validation code can be controlled by implementing the 
dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.model.validation.AssertionValidator interface and injecting the class into the system using a <a href="configuration.html">configuration property</a>.</p>

 
<h3>State management</h3>
<p>Part of the state required for OIOSAML.java to work is stored in static variables by default. This means that the implementation is not
cluster safe. However, the default implementation can be changed, so it is possible to implement a safe state storage instead. The
relevant interface is dk.itst.oiosaml.sp.service.session.SessionHandler. The concrete type which is used at runtime is controlled by the
configuration property oiosaml-sp.sessionhandler, which holds the class name of a class implementing the SessionHandler interface.</p>
