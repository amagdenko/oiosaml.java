<h1>Logging in OIOSAML.java</h1>

<p><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4j</a> is used for logging, and OIOSAML.java contains two types of logs: The system log
which logs runtime information about the processing of requests and responses, and an audit log which logs information about users.</p>

<p>The system log is mostly interesting when something fails. It will contain stack traces, and if set to debug level, al requests and responses will
be logged.</p>
<p>The audit log is interesting when tracking users. It contains information about when AuthnRequests are issued, when responses are
returned, and when users are logged in and out.</p>


<h2>Configuring logging</h2>
<p>Logging is configured in ${oiosaml.j.home}/oiosaml-sp.log4j.xml. This file only contains logging configuration for OIOSAML.java itself - application logging should be kept outside.</p>

<p>By default, log events are sent to the console and a file in ${oiosaml.j.home}/logs.</p>
