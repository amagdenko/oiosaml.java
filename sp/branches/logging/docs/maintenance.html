<h2>OIOSAML.java Service Provider Maintenance</h2>

<p>This page describes maintenance tasks after initial configuration and installation.</p>


<h3>Log file rotation</h3>
<p>If OIOSAML.java uses the default log4j implementation then log files are created in {oiosaml-j.home}/logs. These files are rotated automatically by log4j when they reach 10 MB. If this is not appropriate, this policy can be edited in ~/.oiosaml/oiosaml-sp.log4j.xml.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>
<p>After initial configuration, a backup can be made of the ~/.oiosaml dir. All filter configuration is stored here. If necessary, periodical backups can be made of the log files.</p>


<h3>Certificate expiration</h3>

<p>Both the IdP and SP certificates can expire at some point. Currently, there is no monitoring facilities built into OIOSAML.java, so no warnings will be given.</p>

<h4>Upgrading the IdP certificate</h4>
<p>To replace the IdP certificate, simply replace the entire IdP metadata file in ~/.oiosaml/metadata/IdP and restart the application.</p>

<p>OIOSAML.java also supports rolling upgrades of the IdP certificate. To do this, place the new metadata file together with the old file
and restart the application. Then OIOSAML encounters multiple IdP metadata files for the same IdP (identified by the EntityId), it will
collapse the files and merge the certificates. When checking signatures, all certificates for the IdP will be used for checking, and if one of
them succeeds, the signature will be valid.</p> 

<h4>Upgrading the Service Provider certificate</h4>
<p>Upgrading the SP certificate can be problematic if the IdP cannot be controlled directly. Some IdPs makes it possible to register multiple
 certificates for one SP. If that is the case, the upgrade process should be the following:</p>
 <ul>
 	<li>Get the new certificate</li>
 	<li>Register it in the IdP along with the old certificate</li>
 	<li>When the certificate has been registered with the IdP, copy the new certificate (in PKCS12 or JKS format) to $oiosaml.home</li>
 	<li>Edit oiosaml-sp.properties and point oiosaml-sp.certificate.location to the new keystore, and oiosaml-sp.certificate.password 
 	to the password of the new certificate</li>
 	<li>Restart the SP application</li>
 </ul>

<p>If the IdP does not support rolling upgrades, it will be hard to avoid any downtime, as the SP restart will have to be coordinated
with upgrading the IdP. In this case, the SP metadata must be imported in the IdP once again. In this case, the process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get the new certificate</li>
	<li>Copy the new certificate (in PKCS12 or JKS format) to $oiosaml.home</li>
 	<li>Edit oiosaml-sp.properties and point oiosaml-sp.certificate.location to the new keystore, and oiosaml-sp.certificate.password 
 	to the password of the new certificate</li>
 	<li>Restart the SP application</li>
 	<li>Go to /saml/metadata to retrieve the new SP metadata file</li>
 	<li>Register the new metadata in the IdP</li>
</ul>
